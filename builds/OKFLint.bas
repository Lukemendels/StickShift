' =====================================================================
'  OKF Lint  (deterministic integrity checker, no model, no mutation)
'
'  Scans every concept .md file under BUNDLE_ROOT and writes a
'  colour-coded findings table to an "OKF Lint Report" worksheet.
'  The report file is the worksheet — it lives inside the workbook,
'  never as a .md file, so the generator never indexes it.
'
'  Checks performed:
'    1. Missing / empty `type` field          (OKF conformance)
'    2. Missing `status`, `effort`, `impact`  (schema required)
'    3. Broken cross-links                    (.md links whose target is absent)
'    4. WIP violation                         (> 1 build at status:working)
'    5. Stalls                                (working + missing/old last_touched,
'                                              oldest first in report)
'    6. Pending .proposed files               (staged edits awaiting review)
'    7. Active-to-archived links              (non-archived build → archived build)
'
'  Each finding: severity (error / warning), file, one-line description.
'
'  *** BUNDLE_ROOT must match the value in OKFIndexGenerator.bas ***
