' =====================================================================
'  StickShift Write Apply  (conformant OKF v0.1 writer)
'
'  Reads a <VBA_WRITE> envelope from the clipboard (output of the
'  Portfolio Writer DHSChat Assistant), parses each ### FILE: block,
'  and writes every file directly (creating parent dirs as needed).
'
'  Machine-owned files (log.md, index.md) are never overwritten by a
'  write block. Every write is appended to the bundle-root log.md as
'  an append-only audit trail: action = new | edit.
'
'  After applying, calls GenerateStickShiftIndexes so new builds appear
'  in the index immediately.
'
'  Requires: StickShiftClipboard module (GetClipboardText),
'            StickShiftConfig module, StickShiftIndexGenerator module.
'  Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects 2.x (ADODB.Stream for UTF-8 I/O).
'
'  StickShiftConfig         -> BundleRoot, BundleRootRaw, SetBundleRoot
'  StickShiftWriteApply     -> ApplyStickShiftWrite, ApplyWriteEnvelopeText
