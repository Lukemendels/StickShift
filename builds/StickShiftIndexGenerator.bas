' =====================================================================
'  StickShift Index Generator -- OKF-compliant
'  (conformant OKF v0.1 producer)
'
'  Walks a bundle tree and (re)writes an index.md in every directory,
'  per SPEC.md Sec.6:
'    - index.md files carry NO frontmatter ...
'    - ... EXCEPT the bundle-root index.md, which MAY carry exactly one
'      frontmatter key: okf_version (SPEC Sec.11).
'    - Body = sections grouping concepts under headings, each entry
'      "* [Title](relative-url) - description".
'    - Entries include the description from the linked concept's frontmatter.
'    - Reserved filenames (index.md, log.md) are never listed as concepts.
'
'  Grouping is inferred from the concepts' own frontmatter (not declared):
'    - The first field in GROUP_BY_CANDIDATES that any concept in the folder
'      carries wins as the grouping axis -> lifecycle board with headings.
'    - If no candidate field is present in any concept -> one flat alphabetical
'      list, no group headings (e.g. skills/ folder which carries no status).
'    - Group headings follow GROUP_ORDER, then any extras alpha.
'    - The STALL_GROUP ("working") sorts oldest-last_touched first and shows
'      the date inline, so stalled builds float to the top of the active section.
'    - Subdirectories listed under a "# Subdirectories" heading per Sec.6.
'    - UTF-8 in and out (SPEC Sec.4: concepts are UTF-8 markdown).
'
'  Requires (Tools -> References): Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects 2.x
'  (Scripting.FileSystemObject / Dictionary are late-bound below.)
